# 🛡️ AWS Security Labs

This project contains a series of hands-on labs focused on **AWS security fundamentals**, designed to reinforce best practices across cloud identity, infrastructure, monitoring, and incident response.

## 🔍 Overview

The labs simulate real-world cloud security challenges and walk through:

- Identity and Access Management (IAM) misconfigurations
- Privilege escalation paths
- S3 bucket mispermissions
- Logging and monitoring with CloudTrail & GuardDuty
- Incident response workflows
- Key Management Service (KMS) usage and abuse

## 🎯 Objectives
